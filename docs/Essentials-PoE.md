# PoE Design Principles for HIOX

## Core Principles

1. **Player Agency** - Crafting systems give players control over item creation
2. **Structural Constraints** - Limits (prefix/suffix, rarity caps) force meaningful choices
3. **Layered Progression** - Tier systems reward advancement without overwhelming new players
4. **Simple Surface, Endless Depth** - Easy to start, complex to master
5. **Build Diversity** - Synergistic mods enable distinct archetypes
6. **Risk/Reward Balance** - Crafting involves strategic gambling
7. **Aspirational Perfection** - Incremental improvements always possible, "perfect" items rare

## Applicable Concepts

| PoE Feature | HIOX Adaptation |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Rarity Tiers** | Normal/Magic(2)/Rare(6)/Unique for mod drops |
| **Prefix/Suffix** | Categorize mods (Offensive/Defensive) to prevent over-stacking |
| **Modifier Tiers** | Scale with beacon level/area difficulty (early: +10%, late: +50%) |
| **Currency Crafting** | Nanite canisters: Transmute, Chaos, Exalted, Essence variants |
| **Build-Enabling Uniques** | Items that change gameplay mechanics, not just boost stats |
| **Weighting System** | Control mod rarity via probability weights (chase mods) |
| **Synergy Design** | Mods interact multiplicatively ("Gain damage = 1% max HP") |
| **Trade-offs** | Powerful effects require meaningful downsides |

## What NOT to Copy

- Extreme crafting complexity (20+ currency types, metacrafting)
- Trade economy mechanics (HIOX is single-player)
- Infinite mod pool (keep manageable scope)
- League-specific mechanics
- Socket/link/gem system (different gear paradigm)
- External tool dependency (Path of Building equivalent)

## Design Guidelines

1. **Keep Surface Simple** - Basic crafting obvious, advanced techniques discoverable
2. **Force Meaningful Choices** - Use structural limits (mod slots, prefix/suffix caps)
3. **Maintain Nanite Lore** - All items/currency fit nanomolecular theme
4. **Build-Enabling > Stat Increases** - Design uniques that enable strategies, not just bigger numbers
5. **Balance for Solo Play** - No economy balancing, focus on player satisfaction
