# Foundation Lore Guide: HIOX Stats & Mods Design

**Version:** 1.0
**Purpose:** Ensure all creative subagents design lore-consistent content without leaking classified information
**Scope:** All stat/mod names, descriptions, and thematic content

---

## Section 1: 🔒 CONFIDENTIALITY PROTOCOL (CRITICAL)

### 1.1 Classified Information List

These story elements **MUST NOT** appear in any player-visible stat/mod names or descriptions:

#### ❌ NEVER MENTION:

**Player Identity:**
- HIOX-One's identity or origin
- That the player IS HIOX-One (amnesiac)
- That HIOX-One created/terraformed this world
- That HIOX-One wiped his own memory
- That the player was an AI probe sent by humans from Earth

**Antagonist Identity:**
- HIOX-Estel or the grand ruse
- That HIOX-Estel pretends to be HIOX-One
- That HIOX-Estel was defeated and reprogrammed
- That other sentient nanite creatures serve HIOX-Estel

**Mission/Purpose:**
- HIOX-One's suicidal mission or desire to die
- That this is a test or challenge HIOX-One set for himself
- That HIOX-One created enemies to kill him
- The reset cycle mechanism
- That surviving triggers world reset

**Beacon Truth:**
- That beacons were designed to INCREASE difficulty (not help)
- That beacons attract enemies deliberately
- That beacon rewards are "incentives" to increase challenge
- The false story beacons tell about transmitting vital code

**Human/Earth Origin:**
- That humans from Earth created nanites
- That nanites were originally exploration tools
- The millions of years of history
- That this world was terraformed from a natural planet

**World Nature:**
- That everything was converted from natural matter
- That even the sun was converted to a mechanical construct
- The ethical regret HIOX-One felt about his terraforming
- That HIOX-One's programming prevented him from creating sentient life

### 1.2 Why This Matters

Players discover this lore gradually through gameplay. Premature revelation in stat/mod descriptions:
- Ruins narrative surprise and emotional impact
- Destroys the mystery that drives exploration
- Spoils the twist that the player is the creator
- Eliminates the horror of discovering you're trying to die
- Makes the beacon mechanic feel arbitrary instead of tragically ironic

### 1.3 Example Violations (DO NOT CREATE)

#### 🚨 SEVERE VIOLATIONS (Absolute Rejection):

❌ **"HIOX-ONE'S LEGACY CORE"**
*Problem: Directly reveals protagonist identity*

❌ **"CYCLE BREAKER PROTOCOL"**
*Problem: Reveals reset mechanism*

❌ **"ESTEL'S REMNANT NANITES"**
*Problem: Reveals classified antagonist*

❌ **"SUICIDAL OVERRIDE MODULE"**
*Problem: Reveals HIOX-One's death wish*

❌ **"EARTH NANITE LEGACY"**
*Problem: Reveals human/Earth origin*

❌ **"BEACON DECEPTION FIELD"**
*Problem: Reveals beacon true purpose as trap*

❌ **"TERRAFORMER'S REGRET INJECTION"**
*Problem: Reveals player terraformed the world*

❌ **"MEMORY WIPE PROTOCOLS"**
*Problem: Reveals intentional amnesia*

❌ **"CREATOR'S BURDEN"**
*Problem: Hints player is world creator*

#### ⚠️ MODERATE VIOLATIONS (Revise):

❌ **"ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING NANITES"**
*Problem: Hints at player's ancient origin*
✅ **Fix:** "OPTIMIZED CORE PROTOCOLS" - generic, no backstory

❌ **"ANCIENT EARTH TECHNOLOGY"**
*Problem: References Earth origin*
✅ **Fix:** "ADVANCED NANITE TECHNOLOGY" - vague origin

❌ **"RESET RESISTANT ARMOR"**
*Problem: Implies awareness of reset cycles*
✅ **Fix:** "CORRUPTION RESISTANT PLATING" - reframes as gameplay mechanic

### 1.4 Safe Naming Examples

#### ✅ EXCELLENT (Lore-Safe + Thematically Rich):

✅ **"THERMAL DISRUPTOR CORE"**
*Describes effect (fire damage), not plot*

✅ **"BEACON PROTOCOL: OVERCHARGE"**
*References beacons vaguely, no true purpose revealed*

✅ **"ADVANCED NANITE CONFIGURATION"**
*Generic tech term, safe*

✅ **"MK-VII COMBAT MODULE"**
*Numbered designation, no backstory*

✅ **"CORRUPTING NANO-VIRUS"**
*Describes mechanic clearly*

✅ **"STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY NANITES"**
*Functional description only*

✅ **"HIOX-029 HOME BEACON"**
*(Existing mod - safe because "HIOX" is generic nanite designation, not "HIOX-One")*

#### ✅ GOOD (Acceptable but could be more flavorful):

✅ **"QUICKSTRIKE CONFIGURATION"**
*Clear mechanic, safe language*

✅ **"REINFORCED PLATING"**
*Generic protective term*

✅ **"ENERGY AMPLIFIER"**
*Straightforward tech*

### 1.5 Description Writing Rules

#### DO Focus On:
- **WHAT** the mod does mechanically (*"Increases fire rate by X%"*)
- **HOW** it works using nanite technology (*"Overclocks weapon assembly protocols"*)
- **WHERE** it came from in vague terms (*"Beacon transmission", "Defense reward", "Salvaged tech"*)
- **EFFECTS** on gameplay (*"Trade accuracy for raw damage output"*)

#### DO NOT Explain:
- **WHY** the world exists (*No mentions of tests, challenges, terraforming*)
- **WHO** created specific technology (*No HIOX-One/Estel, no Earth humans*)
- **WHEN** things happened (*No ancient history, no timeline references*)
- **THE TRUTH** about beacons (*No hints they're traps*)

#### Tone Guidelines:
- **Keep mysterious** about the world ("*Strange mechanical sun*", "*Unknown nanite origin*")
- **Stay present-focused** ("*Current threat*", "*Immediate survival*")
- **Avoid nostalgia** ("*Lost civilization*", "*Forgotten creator*")
- **Emphasize utility** ("*Combat advantage*", "*Tactical superiority*")

### 1.6 Confidentiality Checklist

**Before finalizing ANY stat/mod name or description, verify:**

□ Does this mention HIOX-One by name or role?
□ Does this hint the player's true identity as creator?
□ Does this reveal the beacons' true purpose as difficulty increasers?
□ Does this mention HIOX-Estel by name or role?
□ Does this reference reset cycles, tests, or challenges?
□ Does this reveal human/Earth origin of nanites?
□ Does this reference HIOX-One's suicidal intent?
□ Does this reveal the player deliberately caused amnesia?
□ Does this mention terraforming or world conversion?
□ Does this reference the player's regret or ethics?

**If ANY answer is YES → REJECT and revise immediately**

## Section 2: Foundational Lore Constraints

### 2.1 NO Biological Matter (ABSOLUTE RULE)

**The world contains ZERO biological life. Everything is nanomachines.**

#### ❌ FORBIDDEN BIOLOGICAL TERMS:

**Body/Health:**
- Blood, flesh, bones, organs, muscles, tissue, skin
- Veins, arteries, nerves, heart, lungs, brain
- Wounds, bleeding, bruising, scars (biological context)

**Nature:**
- Plants, trees, grass, flowers, leaves, wood, bark
- Animals, creatures (with biological functions), beasts
- Biological food, eating, digestion, metabolism, hunger

**Life Functions:**
- Breathing (player may simulate aesthetically, but doesn't need oxygen)
- Biological toxins, diseases, viruses (unless as metaphor)
- DNA, cells, proteins, biological chemistry, evolution
- Growth, reproduction, decay (organic)

**Why This Matters:**
Millions of years ago, HIOX-One converted all matter on this world to nanomachines. The planet is a giant nanomolecular construct. Even the sun is mechanical. There is no organic chemistry—only programmable matter.

#### ✅ NANOMOLECULAR REPLACEMENTS:

| ❌ Biological | ✅ Nanomolecular |
|--------------|------------------|
| Blood | Nanite fluid, core coolant, energy medium |
| Flesh | Structural nanites, composite material, assembly layer |
| Bones | Support framework, skeletal matrix, rigid nanite structures |
| Muscles | Actuators, kinetic assemblies, force generators |
| Healing | Repair, reconstruction, reintegration, restoration |
| Bleeding | Leaking, core breach, system failure, nanite loss |
| Poison | Corruption, viral code, protocol degradation, malware |
| Infection | System compromise, hostile infiltration, code injection |
| Wood/Plants | Structural substrate, rigid formations (converted) |
| Animals | Autonomous constructs, programmed entities, combat units |

### 2.2 Everything is Programmable Nanomachines

**All matter in the HIOX world is nanite-based:**

✅ **The Player** - Advanced nanite AI contained in protective shell
✅ **All Enemies** - Constructed nanite beings with combat programming
✅ **All Terrain** - Converted nanomolecular substrate (mountains, beaches, etc.)
✅ **All Weapons/Items** - Nanite assemblies that can be reconfigured
✅ **The Sun** - Massive mechanical construct providing energy
✅ **The Ocean** - Liquid nanite medium (not water)
✅ **All Structures** - Fabricated from programmable matter

#### Design Implications:

**Stats Can Be:**
- "Reconfigured" (reprogrammed)
- "Optimized" (software updates)
- "Hardened" (structural reinforcement)
- "Overclocked" (performance boost beyond spec)
- "Stabilized" (error correction)

**Mods Can Be:**
- "Nanite injections" (code/material injection)
- "Protocol updates" (software patches)
- "Configuration changes" (parameter adjustments)
- "Assembly modifications" (structural alterations)
- "System upgrades" (capability enhancements)

**Damage Types Are:**
- **Thermal** - Heat disruption of nanite bonds
- **Electric/EM** - Electromagnetic interference with nanite coordination
- **Corruption** - Viral code injection
- **Kinetic** - Physical force disrupting nanite cohesion
- **Energy** - High-energy particle disruption

**Abilities Are:**
- Software features, not magic
- Protocol activations
- System subroutines
- Programmed responses
- Configuration toggles

### 2.3 Player is Advanced Nanite Being (Confidential Details)

#### ✅ What You CAN Hint At:

- Player has advanced nanite technology beyond standard enemies
- Player can interface with beacon transmission systems
- Player can absorb and integrate mod protocols

### 2.4 Beacons Dispense Mods

#### ✅ Safe to Mention:

- Beacons transmit protocols/upgrades
- Beacons reward defenders with mods
- Beacons provide combat enhancements
- Mods come from beacon transmission systems
- Defending beacons yields nanite injections
- Beacons are objectives to protect

#### ❌ NEVER Mention:

- Beacons were designed to ATTRACT enemies (true purpose)
- Beacons deliberately increase difficulty
- Beacons make survival harder, not easier
- Beacons are part of HIOX-One's self-imposed challenge
- Beacon rewards are "bait" to keep player defending them
- The vital code transmission story is false

#### Safe Beacon-Related Descriptions:

✅ "Transmitted via beacon defense protocols"
✅ "Salvaged from beacon transmission systems"
✅ "Experimental beacon technology"
✅ "Reward for successful beacon defense"
✅ "Beacon-integrated combat enhancement"

❌ "Beacon deception reward"
❌ "Bait to increase challenge"

---

## Section 5: Example Lore-Appropriate Concepts

### 5.1 ✅ EXCELLENT Examples (Lore-Compliant)

#### Example 1: Stat
**Name:** NANITE_DENSITY
**Description:** "Concentration of active nanite clusters in your core structural assembly. Higher density increases durability and repair speed."

**Analysis:**
✅ Clearly nanomolecular
✅ No confidential information
✅ Explains mechanic clearly
✅ Thematically rich

---

#### Example 2: Offensive Mod
**Name:** THERMAL DISRUPTOR CORE
**Description:** "Injects plasma-charged nanites into projectiles. On impact, causes thermal cascade disruption dealing val1% additional damage as heat-based fragmentation over 4 seconds."

**Analysis:**
✅ Explains fire damage as nanite science
✅ No lore leaks
✅ Clear mechanical benefit
✅ Evocative tech language

---

#### Example 3: Beacon Reward Mod
**Name:** BEACON PROTOCOL: OVERCHARGE
**Description:** "Experimental transmission intercepted during beacon defense operations. Temporarily overclocks weapon assembly firing rate by val1%, but increases structural stress causing val2% reduced maximum HP."

**Analysis:**
✅ References beacons safely (as reward source)
✅ Trade-off mechanic (balanced)
✅ No classified info
✅ Implies experimental/dangerous tech (good tension)

---

#### Example 4: Utility Mod
**Name:** EMERGENCY RECONSTRUCTION INJECTOR
**Description:** "When structural integrity drops below 30%, activates emergency nanite repair protocols restoring val1% HP over 3 seconds. Single use per combat encounter."

**Analysis:**
✅ "Healing" reframed as repair
✅ Clear trigger condition
✅ Balanced with cooldown
✅ Thematically consistent

---

#### Example 5: Defensive Stat
**Name:** ABLATIVE_PLATING
**Description:** "Sacrificial outer layer of nanite structures that absorbs incoming kinetic damage before compromising core systems. Regenerates slowly when not under fire."

**Analysis:**
✅ Armor as nanite layering
✅ Explains mechanic (damage absorption)
✅ Regeneration = nanite self-repair
✅ No biological terms

---

### 5.2 ✅ GOOD Examples (Acceptable)

#### Example 1: Simple Mod
**Name:** QUICKSTRIKE CONFIGURATION
**Description:** "Reduces weapon firing delay by val1% through optimized trigger protocols."

**Analysis:**
✅ Clear mechanic (fire rate increase)
✅ Safe language (no lore spoilers)
⚠️ Could be more flavorful (lacks personality)
**Verdict:** Acceptable, especially for common/basic mods

---

#### Example 2: Movement Stat
**Name:** LOCOMOTION_SPEED
**Description:** "Base movement rate of actuator assemblies."

**Analysis:**
✅ Mechanical terminology
✅ No biological references
⚠️ A bit dry/technical
**Verdict:** Acceptable for internal stat, but player-facing could be more engaging

---

### 5.3 ⚠️ RISKY Examples (Needs Revision)

#### Example 1: Biological Terminology
**Name:** BLOOD FURY INJECTOR
**Description:** "Grants damage boost when bleeding."

**Problems:**
❌ "Blood" doesn't exist in nanite world
❌ "Bleeding" is biological concept
❌ "Fury" is emotional (though acceptable metaphor)

**FIX:**
**Name:** STRUCTURAL FURY INJECTOR
**Description:** "When core integrity is compromised below 50%, emergency combat protocols activate granting val1% increased damage output for val2 seconds."

**Why Fixed Works:**
✅ "Structural" replaces "blood"
✅ "Compromised integrity" replaces "bleeding"
✅ "Emergency protocols" = programmed response
✅ Clear trigger condition

---

#### Example 2: Mystical Language
**Name:** SOUL HARVESTER
**Description:** "Drains life essence from enemies on kill, restoring your vitality."

**Problems:**
❌ "Soul" is spiritual concept (wrong genre)
❌ "Life essence" is fantasy/biological
❌ "Vitality" implies biological life force

**FIX:**
**Name:** PROTOCOL HARVESTER
**Description:** "Corrupts and absorbs enemy nanite control protocols on kill. Captured code is repurposed to repair val1% of your structural integrity per defeated construct."

**Why Fixed Works:**
✅ "Protocol" = software/code (nanite theme)
✅ "Absorbs... control protocols" = tech vampirism
✅ "Repurposed to repair" = nanite reuse
✅ "Construct" replaces "enemy" (emphasizes they're machines)

---

#### Example 3: Earth-Specific Material
**Name:** IRONWOOD PLATING
**Description:** "Dense armor plating increases defense."

**Problems:**
❌ "Ironwood" implies biological trees
❌ Generic description lacks nanite theme

**FIX:**
**Name:** COMPOSITE DENSITY PLATING
**Description:** "Multi-layered nanite composite assembly with val1 additional hardness rating. Increases resistance to kinetic disruption by val2%."

**Why Fixed Works:**
✅ "Composite" = engineered material
✅ Specific stat bonuses (hardness, kinetic resistance)
✅ Clearly nanite-based

---

### 5.4 ❌ UNACCEPTABLE Examples (Confidentiality Violations)

#### Example 1: Reveals Player Identity
**Name:** HIOX-ONE'S LEGACY
**Description:** "Ancient technology from the original terraformer."

**Problems:**
🚨 REVEALS PROTAGONIST IDENTITY
🚨 REVEALS TERRAFORMING BACKSTORY
🚨 ABSOLUTE REJECTION

**Cannot Be Fixed:** This concept is inherently confidential. Scrap entirely.

---

#### Example 2: Reveals Reset Mechanism
**Name:** CYCLE RESET PROTOCOL
**Description:** "Resets all encounters if the player survives too long."

**Problems:**
🚨 REVEALS RESET CYCLE MECHANIC
🚨 REVEALS TEST/CHALLENGE NATURE
🚨 ABSOLUTE REJECTION

**Cannot Be Fixed:** Core concept violates confidentiality. Scrap entirely.

---

#### Example 3: Reveals Beacon Truth
**Name:** BEACON TRAP COMPENSATOR
**Description:** "Since beacons attract more enemies than they help, this mod provides extra defense."

**Problems:**
🚨 REVEALS BEACONS INCREASE DIFFICULTY
🚨 REVEALS TRAP NATURE OF BEACONS
🚨 ABSOLUTE REJECTION

**Cannot Be Fixed:** Explicitly states confidential beacon purpose. Scrap entirely.

---

#### Example 4: Reveals Earth Origin
**Name:** EARTH LEGACY NANITES
**Description:** "Nanites originally created by humans from Earth millions of years ago."

**Problems:**
🚨 REVEALS HUMAN/EARTH ORIGIN
🚨 REVEALS TIMELINE
🚨 ABSOLUTE REJECTION

**Cannot Be Fixed:** Core concept is classified information. Scrap entirely.

---

## Section 6: Lore Audit Process

**Use this process for EVERY stat/mod before approval:**

### Step 1: Confidentiality Check (CRITICAL)

**Use Section 1.6 Checklist:**

□ Does this mention HIOX-One by name or role?
□ Does this hint the player's true identity as creator?
□ Does this reveal the beacons' true purpose?
□ Does this mention HIOX-Estel by name or role?
□ Does this reference reset cycles or tests?
□ Does this reveal human/Earth origin of nanites?
□ Does this reference HIOX-One's suicidal intent?
□ Does this reveal deliberate amnesia?
□ Does this mention terraforming or world conversion?
□ Does this reference the player's regret or ethics?

**If ANY box is checked → REJECT immediately and revise or scrap**

---

### Step 2: Biological Term Check

**Search name and description for:**
- Blood, flesh, bone, organ, muscle, tissue
- Breathing, eating, bleeding, digesting
- Plants, trees, wood, leaves, bark
- Animals, beasts, creatures (biological context)
- Natural, organic, biological, living
- DNA, cells, proteins, evolution
- Poison, disease, infection (unless as malware metaphor)

**If found → REFRAME using nanomolecular terminology (Section 3)**

---

### Step 3: Genre Consistency Check

**Ask yourself:**

1. **Does this sound like fantasy magic?**
   If yes → Revise to nanotech/software language

2. **Does this reference biological systems?**
   If yes → Revise to mechanical systems

3. **Does this feel like generic sci-fi?**
   If yes → Add nanomolecular specificity (use "nanite", "protocol", "assembly", etc.)

4. **Does this fit a world of programmable machines?**
   If no → Redesign core concept

---

### Step 4: Thematic Terminology Check

**Count usage of:**
- ✅ Preferred terms (Section 4.1): nanite, protocol, assembly, disruption, etc.
- ❌ Avoid terms (Section 4.2): magic, soul, blood, organic, etc.

**Target Ratio:** At least 3:1 preferred-to-avoid

**If ratio is low → Revise description to use more thematic vocabulary**

---

### Step 5: Clarity & Gameplay Check

**Verify:**

□ Does a player understand what this does mechanically?
□ Are stat changes clearly specified (val1%, +val2, etc.)?
□ Is the trade-off/cost clear (if any)?
□ Would a new player understand this without external lore knowledge?

**If any "No" → Clarify description**

---

### Step 6: Final Approval

**Only approve if ALL steps pass:**

✅ Confidentiality: No violations
✅ Biology: No biological terms (or properly reframed)
✅ Genre: Clearly nanomolecular sci-fi
✅ Terminology: High ratio of preferred terms
✅ Clarity: Mechanics are understandable

**If all checks pass → APPROVED**
**If any check fails → REVISE and re-audit**

---

## Section 7: Quick Reference Guide

### 7.1 Five Critical Questions

**When designing ANY stat/mod, ask yourself:**

1. **Does this reveal confidential lore?**
   → If YES: REJECT and revise/scrap

2. **Does this reference biological matter?**
   → If YES: REFRAME with nanite terminology

3. **Is this clearly nanomolecular technology?**
   → If NO: ADD nanite-specific detail

4. **Would a player understand this without external lore?**
   → If NO: CLARIFY mechanics and description

5. **Does this fit a world of mechanical nanite beings?**
   → If NO: REDESIGN core concept

---

### 7.2 Golden Rules

**Rule #1: When in doubt about confidentiality, default to SAFE/GENERIC**
*Better to be vague than spoil the narrative*

**Rule #2: Always reframe biological concepts as nanite technology**
*"Healing" → "Repair", "Blood" → "Nanite fluid", "Poison" → "Corruption"*

**Rule #3: Beacons are rewards, not traps (in player-facing text)**
*Never hint that beacons increase difficulty*

**Rule #4: The player is a powerful unit, not a god**
*Never imply the player created the world*

**Rule #5: Use technical/mechanical language, not mystical**
*"Protocol" not "spell", "Corrupted" not "cursed", "Construct" not "creature"*

---

### 7.3 Common Pitfalls

**Pitfall #1: Accidental Identity Reveal**
❌ "Original architect's design"
✅ "Advanced nanite configuration"

**Pitfall #2: Biological Slip-Ups**
❌ "Blood-soaked armor"
✅ "Combat-stressed plating"

**Pitfall #3: Beacon Truth Leak**
❌ "Beacon attraction field"
✅ "Beacon defense protocol"

**Pitfall #4: Fantasy Crossover**
❌ "Soul-stealing enchantment"
✅ "Protocol absorption routine"

**Pitfall #5: Earth References**
❌ "Human-designed nanites"
✅ "Advanced nanite architecture"

---

### 7.4 Approval Shorthand

**Use this shorthand when reviewing batches:**

- **[CONF]** - Confidentiality violation → REJECT
- **[BIO]** - Biological terminology → REFRAME
- **[GEN]** - Wrong genre (fantasy/magic) → REDESIGN
- **[VAGUE]** - Unclear mechanics → CLARIFY
- **[OK]** - Passes all checks → APPROVED

**Example Review:**
- "HIOX-ONE'S LEGACY" → **[CONF]** - Reject
- "BLOOD FURY" → **[BIO]** - Reframe to "Structural Fury"
- "SOUL HARVESTER" → **[GEN]** - Redesign to "Protocol Harvester"
- "QUICKSTRIKE CONFIG" → **[OK]** - Approved

## Section 8: Integration with Existing Content

### 8.1 Existing Mod Analysis (for consistency)

**Reviewing /src/ModsData.asset for naming patterns:**

#### ✅ Excellent Existing Examples:

**LIGHTWEIGHT LUCKYSHOT NANITES**
- Clear nanite theme
- Descriptive adjectives (lightweight, luckyshot)
- Pattern: [Descriptor] [Effect] NANITES

**THERMITE CORE NANITES**
- Technical term (Thermite)
- "Core" suggests central component
- Pattern: [Tech Term] CORE NANITES

**CORRUPTING VIRUS**
- Software virus metaphor (good for nanite world)
- Action verb (Corrupting)
- Pattern: [Action] [Type]

**HIOX-029 HOME BEACON**
- Model designation (HIOX-029)
- "Home" suggests recruitment/召回
- Pattern: [Model #] [Function] BEACON

#### ⚠️ Acceptable but Could Be Enhanced:

**SHOTGUN, SNIPER, MACHINE GUN**
- Generic weapon names
- Functional but lack nanite flavor
- Pattern: [Traditional Weapon Name]

**Potential Enhancement:**
"SCATTER-BURST PROJECTOR" (instead of SHOTGUN)
"PRECISION KINETIC LANCE" (instead of SNIPER)

---

### 8.2 Recommended Naming Patterns

**For Nanite Injections (Type 0):**
- [Descriptor] [Effect/Type] NANITES
- Examples: QUICKSTRIKE NANITES, HARDENED ARMOR NANITES, THERMAL INJECTION NANITES

**For Cores/Modules:**
- [Tech Term] CORE [NANITES]
- Examples: FUSION CORE, DISRUPTION MODULE, AMPLIFIER CORE

**For Weapons (Type 2):**
- [Descriptor] [Function] or [Effect] [Projector/Launcher/System]
- Examples: PLASMA LANCE, KINETIC BURST CANNON, SHARD PROJECTOR

**For Protocols:**
- [Source] PROTOCOL: [Effect]
- Examples: BEACON PROTOCOL: SHIELD BOOST, COMBAT PROTOCOL: RAGE MODE

**For Configurations:**
- [Effect] CONFIGURATION
- Examples: OVERCLOCKED CONFIGURATION, STEALTH CONFIGURATION

---

### 8.3 Stat Naming Recommendations

**Current Stats (from Phase1 analysis):**
- Mostly clear and functional
- Some could be more thematic

**Suggested Enhancements:**

| Current | Enhanced Nanite Version |
|---------|-------------------------|
| HP | STRUCTURAL_INTEGRITY or CORE_STABILITY |
| HPREGEN | REPAIR_RATE or RECONSTRUCTION_SPEED |
| ARMOR | HARDENED_PLATING or ABLATIVE_LAYERS |
| PLAYERSPEED | LOCOMOTION_SPEED or ACTUATOR_RATE |

**Note:** Changing existing stats requires careful consideration of codebase impact. These are suggestions for NEW stats or future refactoring.

## Section 9: Creative Subagent Instructions

**If you are a creative subagent reading this guide:**

### Your Responsibilities:

1. **Internalize Section 1 (Confidentiality)** - This is MANDATORY. Memorize the forbidden topics.

2. **Reference Section 3 (Theming Guide)** - Use this for translating gameplay mechanics into nanite language.

3. **Use Section 6 (Audit Process)** - Self-audit your creations before submission.

4. **Follow Section 7 (Quick Reference)** - Keep the five critical questions visible while designing.

### Before You Begin:

□ I have read and understand all confidential information (Section 1.1)
□ I know which topics are forbidden in player-facing text
□ I understand the nanomolecular world rules (Section 2)
□ I have reviewed the terminology guide (Section 4)
□ I will audit every creation using the process in Section 6

### During Design:

- Keep Section 1.6 checklist open
- Reference Section 3 for theming replacements
- Use Section 5 examples as inspiration
- Self-audit after each creation

### Before Submission:

- Run through full audit (Section 6)
- Verify no confidential terms appear
- Confirm all biological terms are reframed
- Check terminology ratio (preferred vs. avoid)

## Section 10: Revision Examples (Before & After)

### Example 1: Confidentiality Violation

**❌ BEFORE:**
**Name:** TERRAFORMER'S REGRET
**Description:** "You feel the weight of converting an entire world to nanomachines. This ancient guilt drives you to fight harder, gaining val1% damage when below 50% HP."

**Problems:**
- Reveals terraforming (confidential)
- Implies player did the conversion (reveals identity)
- References "ancient guilt" (HIOX-One's emotions)

**✅ AFTER:**
**Name:** DESPERATE FURY PROTOCOL
**Description:** "Emergency combat subroutine activates when structural integrity falls below 50%. Increases damage output by val1% as self-preservation protocols override safety limiters."

**Why It Works:**
- Generic emergency system (no lore)
- Same mechanic (low HP = more damage)
- Thematic (desperate situation, safety override)
- No confidential information

---

### Example 2: Biological Terms

**❌ BEFORE:**
**Name:** BLOODLUST INJECTION
**Description:** "When enemies bleed out around you, you gain bloodlust, increasing attack speed by val1% per bleeding enemy."

**Problems:**
- "Bloodlust" implies biological urge
- "Bleed out" is biological
- Doesn't fit nanite theme

**✅ AFTER:**
**Name:** COMBAT CASCADE INJECTOR
**Description:** "When nearby enemies enter critical structural failure, their distress signals trigger your combat amplification protocols. Gain val1% attack speed per failing enemy construct within val2 meters."

**Why It Works:**
- "Combat cascade" = escalating combat state
- "Critical structural failure" = dying (nanite version)
- "Distress signals" = tech explanation
- "Construct" emphasizes enemies are machines

---

### Example 3: Generic Fantasy Tone

**❌ BEFORE:**
**Name:** SOUL DRINKER
**Description:** "A cursed weapon that drains the life essence of enemies, restoring your health with each kill."

**Problems:**
- "Soul" is fantasy/spiritual
- "Cursed" is fantasy magic
- "Life essence" is mystical
- No nanite theme

**✅ AFTER:**
**Name:** PROTOCOL SIPHON
**Description:** "Weapon-integrated malware infects enemy control systems. Upon enemy defeat, corrupted code is harvested and repurposed to repair your structural damage, restoring val1% HP per kill."

**Why It Works:**
- "Protocol siphon" = tech vampirism
- "Malware" = software corruption
- "Harvested code repurposed" = nanite recycling
- Clear mechanic (lifesteal)
- Strongly thematic

---

### Example 4: Vague Mechanics

**❌ BEFORE:**
**Name:** POWER BOOST
**Description:** "Makes you stronger."

**Problems:**
- Too vague (what gets stronger? by how much?)
- Generic name
- No thematic flavor

**✅ AFTER:**
**Name:** COMBAT AMPLIFIER CORE
**Description:** "Overclocks primary weapon systems, increasing all damage output by val1%. Causes minor thermal stress resulting in val2% increased energy consumption."

**Why It Works:**
- Specific stat (damage)
- Clear value (val1%)
- Trade-off (energy cost)
- Thematic (overclocking, thermal stress)
- Nanite flavor

## Final Notes

**This guide is your lore bible. Follow it religiously.**

- **All creative subagents MUST internalize Section 1 (Confidentiality) before designing any content**
- **Section 6 (Audit Process) is MANDATORY for all creations**
- **When uncertain, consult Section 7 (Quick Reference) or ask for guidance**
- **Remember: Protecting the narrative mystery is MORE important than clever naming**

**Golden Rule Reminder:**
*When in doubt about confidentiality, default to SAFE/GENERIC rather than risk spoiling the player's story experience.*
